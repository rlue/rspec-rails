Feature: view spec

  View specs should be placed in `spec/views`,
  and verify the content of view templates in isolation
  (that is, without invoking a controller).

  Overview
  --------

  View specs generally follow three steps:

  ```ruby
  assign(:widget, Widget.new)  # sets @widget = Widget.new in the view template

  render

  expect(rendered).to match(/text/)
  ```

  1. Use the `assign` method to set instance variables in the view.
     Technically, `@widget = Widget.new` would work too,
     but RSpec doesn't officially support this pattern.
     (It only works as a side effect of the fact that
     view specs include `ActionView::TestCase` behavior.
     Be aware that it may be made unavailable in the future.)

  2. Use the `render` method to render the view.

  3. Set expectations against the resulting `rendered` object.

  Notes
  -----

  * To apply a layout to the view template being rendered,
    be sure to specify both the template and layout explicitly:

    ```ruby
    render :template => "events/show", :layout => "layouts/application"
    ```

  * View specs expose a `controller` object,
    which can be used to set expectations about the route (path + parameters)
    to the view template being tested.
    Some attributes of this object are based on
    the name of the view itselfâ€”that is, in a spec for `events/index.html.erb`:

    * `controller.controller_path == "events"`
    * `controller.request.path_parameters[:controller] == "events"`

    Be careful of these automatically-inferred values
    when writing specs for partials
    (which may be shared across multiple controllers).

  Scenario: View specs render the described view file
    Given a file named "spec/views/widgets/index.html.erb_spec.rb" with:
      """ruby
      require "rails_helper"

      RSpec.describe "widgets/index" do

            Widget.create!(:name => "slicer"),
